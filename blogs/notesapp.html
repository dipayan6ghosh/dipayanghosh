Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online program for the students of various colleges to work on some projects and a stepping stone in the world of open source contributions. These program is especially set for those who are new to open source software development. 
I initially had some basic knowledge of git. But we all know that knowledge is useless unless we apply. My mentor caught my flaws while using GitHub in windows in the mid of December and she send few links and materials to get me accustomed with the use gitbash for faster and easier work. I wanted to take part in Google Summer of Code, but I was unware of the procedures, working of the program which made me less confident. So, I went on.

              <p style="font-size: 110%" class="light">
              The very first step of project selection is the most critical stage that I firmly believe. I kept in mind that I should choose that I am capable to do. Web Developing Projects attracts me the most. From the many topic I thought of working with the “Notes App” which I found to be simple and quite interesting as I have never developed such before. Internet says common available Web based notes are liable of keeping track of notes in a much organized way and keeping the information to oneself safe and secure. I went on with this few key notes. I love to code in Php and JavaScript. My mentor for this project was revered Ankita Sahoo. I sent her a mail and she replied me with the instructions for proceedings. </p>

              It is common with the users for trying to test the system. We know very well that a name i.e. First name and Last name cannot consist of any either numbers or punctuations. Hence, there may be tendency that the user may try to give wrong data either intentionally or unintentionally. In order, to avoid wrong data entry in the database I have added a Java Script thereby allowing only for the alphabet keys to remain enabled while filling the values.

             Wikipedia says “Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern that divides a given application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to, and accepted from, the use. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.”
I have given the MVC Architecture implementation of the entire model for easy, neat access to the pages of the model. I have kept three folders according to the rules namely; model, view and controller and kept the index.php page outside.

            While working in the project, I, found that if we use same username but different email-id there was no problem in a new account creation. This led to a problem that a newly created account with a already registered username can view all the private notes just after creation of such new account. We can clearly understand this is a loop hole, which needs attention. Hence, I change the ‘id’ from primary key to unique key and ‘username’ as our new primary key.

            I have solved this fault and pushed on the same branch that was used for implementation of MVC architecture. This was done by adding a limit in the number of characters that are allowed to be written in the text space. So, after adding it we can see that not even one character more than the fixed number input characters will be allowed to write in the text space. Thus, there will be no data loss from site page to database by truncation.

Three features are added I the Notes App, according to our need, i.e. 1. The User has an extra feature of starring and pinning itself to the top; this feature is really helpful in marking as important and keeping the positons at the top if the top is not of any other pinned notes. 2. Calendar entry was done for date related events in note which can be need at times for a remainder, like party, birthday celebrations, travel, etc.; this feature is really helpful at times by notifying and punching a remainder before the occasion. 3. Last modification time is get stored for after adding notes or editing notes; this feature let us see when did the user has modified the note last.

A very huge thank you to Ankita Sahoo for bearing my silly questions and guiding me throughout. If it wasn’t her, this whole learning process would have a dead end in the middle or it would have taken weeks to complete and the learning curve would have been tough. Lot more to learn from you. Thanks again!! I would also extend my heartiest thank to IIT Kharagpur Open Source Society (KOSS) for conducting such a beginner friendly program. Learning was the main code of conduct for the event.  Hoping for such more events like this in future. A special mention I would definitely love & hope to work again in future under her mentorship. :)
